# UnitTestingTechniques
Project used to keep record of interesting unit testing techniques 

As of right now, this test makes use of CocoaPods to import ThirdParty frameworks, so a [pod install] command will be needed in the terminal.

  The technique currently found in this project showcases how web services may be flattened (made synchronous) for the purpose of unit testing and achieving a higher number of code coverage on our view controllers. This percentage can be seen in the build tab on the left side of XCode's IDE.
